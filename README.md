## Overview

Our solution is an advanced web application designed to address the issue of misarticulation in children by providing therapy materials in Hindi. We leverage cutting-edge AI and ML techniques to create a dynamic and adaptive assessment platform. This README.md provides an overview of our prototype, highlighting its key features and functionalities.

## Key Features

### Adaptive Assessment

Using AI and ML, our platform tailors assessments based on a user's previous responses, optimizing the learning experience. This personalized approach ensures that users receive therapy materials that match their current skill level and progress.

### Speech Sound Identification

Our system identifies specific speech sounds and phonemes that individuals are misarticulating, allowing for targeted therapy. This feature enables precise diagnosis and treatment of speech issues.

### Gamification

To keep therapy engaging, we incorporate gamification elements, making learning fun, especially for children. Gamified elements such as rewards, challenges, and interactive activities motivate users to participate actively in their therapy sessions.

### Spaced Repetition

We implement spaced repetition techniques, allowing users to practice speech sounds over longer intervals for more effective learning. This approach enhances memory retention and the ability to apply correct articulation in real-life situations.

### Visual and Audio Feedback

Users receive visual and audio feedback to help them understand and correct their articulation. Real-time feedback aids in the learning process by providing immediate guidance and reinforcement.

### Interactive Exercises

Our platform includes interactive exercises that challenge users to identify and correct misarticulated speech sounds. These exercises provide hands-on practice and reinforce correct articulation techniques.

### Integration of AI and ML

We employ AI and ML to continuously adapt therapy plans based on user progress. This adaptive learning model ensures that therapy materials remain challenging yet achievable, promoting consistent improvement over time.
